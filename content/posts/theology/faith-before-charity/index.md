> "… the theological virtues stand in a particular relation to one another, as determined both by their objective value and according to the sequence of their developing in the human person. As mother of the virtues, charity ranks hierarchically first among them. But because, as Aquinas puts it, 'no human appetite moves toward anything, either by hoping or loving, unless it be apprehended by sense or mind,' faith precedes the other two virtues in the order of their coming to exist in a person."

Consider the love shared between a baby and its mother. The baby has to know his mother as mother/caregiver, distinguishing her from the rest of his reality, in order to love her. The mother is initially known through her effects—her scent, her milk, her voice, her embrace. Similarly, in our spiritual journey, God must be known, at least by His effects, in order to be loved. Salvation history, as described in Scripture, supports this: God reveals Himself to us so that we may love Him. Without this knowledge of God, He becomes an empty signifier. If we falsely understand God, we love not the true God but a false impression of Him. To love the God of deism is not the same as to love the Trinitarian God. Hence, as our understanding grows, so too might our love.

Note that babies love their mothers due to the relationship and care shown to them. This understanding may not be verbal or propositional but is present in a more instinctual way. Similarly, our adult knowledge of God might also be more implicit, but understanding of God's nature precedes love for God.

You can describe a baby's cry to his mother as an expression of faith and hope that his mother will attend to him. Babies who are conditioned to believe their mother will not help them eventually learn to stop crying. If someone other than the biological mother raises the baby, the baby will attach to this person instead. So it seems like implicit knowledge of the caregiver's role underlies the baby's love.

Also, maturation increases one's ability to love, if love is seen as a volitional act — a gift of self to another. Babies cannot really sacrifice for their mothers, and if the cross represents the height of human love, then it's difficult to argue that babies can love God as well as an adult can. However, God judges each person according to their abilities, so while babies may have “one talent” in this regard, adults have more. "To whom much is given, much is expected." I would think that a good mother loves her baby more than the baby is capable of loving her.

Our knowledge of God is probably similar to how weakly a baby knows its mother. 

> “There is a story that St. Augustine was walking on the beach contemplating the mystery of the Trinity. Then he saw a boy in front of him who had dug a hole in the sand and was going out to the sea again and again and bringing some water to pour into the hole. St. Augustine asked him, ‘What are you doing?’ ‘I’m going to pour the entire ocean into this hole.’ ‘That is impossible, the whole ocean will not fit in the hole you have made’ said St. Augustine. The boy replied, ‘And you cannot fit the Trinity in your tiny little brain.’ The story concludes by saying that the boy vanished because St. Augustine had been talking to an angel.“

I think a good ambition would be to try to fill our minds with as much knowledge of God as they can hold, with the care to distinguish between what is knowable through revelation and reason and what is mystery. 

St. Thomas himself said all his work was straw compared to the beatific vision. Yet God sanctified him through his pursuit of truth and wisdom and prepared him to receive the beatific vision. So the project was still good. All of our faculties should be offered to God including our intellects.
