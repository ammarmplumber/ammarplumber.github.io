I have greatly benefitted from [OptimalWork](https://www.optimalwork.com), an online platform offering a MasterClass on how people can overcome work and life barriers to flourishing. The content was developed by Dr. Kevin Majeres, a board-certified psychiatrist and faculty member at Harvard Medical School.

I've been relaying some of the key concepts of OptimalWork to AdComp employees during a fortnightly lunch seminar. So far, topics covered have been self-mastery and ideals, attention, and reframing.

Discussing these topics has served as an opportunity for me to develop as a speaker, contextualize the ideas to the specific challenges employees are facing, and cement the core concepts in my own head.

I highly recommend a subscription! I also really enjoy tuning into the [Golden Hour](https://open.spotify.com/show/5rGhxWkc95nXZHvr3uCj63?si=9c8607ae20c843a5) podcast, by the same creators.
