> Some people will cross mountain and sea for money. So should you labor for wisdom. 
> â€“ St. Thomas Aquinas

Join us on Sunday evenings for a thoughtful exploration into the moral life, focusing on the ethical teachings derived from philosophical tradition and their contemporary implications. This seminar is accessible globally via Zoom and offered through the Collegium Institute.

## Course Overview

- **Why philosophy?** Human beings naturally seek an answer to this question: what is it all about?
- **What kind of creature is a human being?** A human being is a dependent rational animal.
- **What does it mean to live morally?:** Engage with the concepts of virtue and habit that shape our actions and define our character.
- **What is love?:** Discuss the central role of *charity* in ethical living and social interaction. Understand why love requires self-mastery.
- **Theology of the Body:** Learn how Pope John Paul II's thought on the human body as a gift and a vocation for self-giving love is rooted in the philosophical anthropology of Thomas Aquinas.
