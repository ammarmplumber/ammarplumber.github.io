</h2><p>Ernst Fehr and Klaus Schmidt advocate the use of an &ldquo;inequity aversion&rdquo;
utility function in game theoretic modeling as a means of explaining and
predicting experimental data that money-maximizing models fail to
accommodate. In response to their work, two prominent critical papers
have been put forth: Shaked (2005) and Binmore and Shaked (2010). This
paper aims to explicate and evaluate the criticisms leveled against Fehr
and Schmidt in the second paper.</p>
<p>First, I describe the theory of inequity aversion: how it is formalized,
calibrated, and tested. Furthermore, I will identify exactly what data
Fehr and Schmidt are seeking to explain in proposing the theory and how
they think that their model outperforms the available alternatives.
Then, I discuss a few thematic criticisms. One concerns the
communicative tactics that Fehr and Schmidt use to mask deficiencies of
their theory. Another question is whether their theory is predictively
successful in the first place&mdash;especially with regard to the four games
that Fehr and Schmidt consider. Finally, Binmore and Shaked (2010)
allege that Fehr and Schmidt use different parametric distributions to
fit the data, a tactic that resists falsification. In adjudicating these
criticisms, I consider the responses given in Fehr and Schmidt (2010).
To conclude, I discuss how these criticisms weigh on the credibility of
Fehr and Schmidt&rsquo;s model.</p>

</h2><p>Fehr and Schmidt declare that their intention in proposing the theory of
inequity aversion was to answer the following question: why do subjects
act selfishly in some games but generously and fairly in others? The
simple theory that they settled on was one that they found to be &ldquo;a
tractable tool in more complicated models and that yields quantitative,
testable predictions&rdquo; (p 101).</p>
<p>To clarify the need for an alternative to the standard money-maximizing
model, Fehr and Schmidt (1999, pp 817-818) point to a few experimental
findings. A number of bilateral bargaining experiments seem to indicate
that not all subjects are purely money-maximizers and in fact value
fairness (Güth, Schmittberger, and Tietz 1990; Roth 1995; Camerer and
Thaler 1995). In other contexts, however, it seems that fairness
considerations are not particularly salient (Smith and Williams, 1990;
Roth, Prasnikar, Okuno-Fujiwara, and Zamir, 1991; Kachelmeier and
Shehata, 1992; Güth, Marchand, and Rulliere, 1997). By Fehr and
Schmidt&rsquo;s assessment, traditional money-maximizing models do not explain
these varied findings well, so they apply the assumption that a fraction
of people are motivated by fairness&mdash;modeled as self-centered inequity
aversion. This assumption is formalized according to the following
utility function:</p>
<p>$$U_i(x) = x_i - \frac{a_i}{n - 1} \sum_{j \neq i} (x_j - x_i)^{+} - \frac{\beta_i}{n - 1} \sum_{j \neq i} (x_i - x_j)^{+}$$</p>
<p>where \(0 \leq \beta_i &lt; 1\), \(\beta_i \leq \alpha_i\) and \(x^{+} =\)
max\({ x,0 }\). The parameter \(\alpha\) represents the strength of one&rsquo;s
aversion to others receiving more than oneself, and \(\beta\) is the
strength of one&rsquo;s aversion to receiving more than others. Because the
signs of the last two terms are negative, greater values of \(\alpha\) and
\(\beta\) are associated with utility reductions stemming from inequities.</p>
<p>The inequity aversion theory&rsquo;s <em>prima facie</em> domain of application
extends to all games with more than one player. Fehr and Schmidt place
no apparent constraint on where their theory should be applied besides
this self-evident multi-subject requirement. However, Binmore and Shaked
(2010, p 91) rightly point out that context bears heavily on what people
count as fair. Two specific factors affecting these evaluations include
&ldquo;perceived need and prior investment of effort&rdquo; (p 91). These contextual
factors place an implicit constraint on the theory&rsquo;s domain of
application; insofar as assessments of fairness are not straightforward,
it is unclear how Fehr and Schmidt&rsquo;s utility function can be applied.
Thus, Binmore and Shaked (2010) restrict their attention to the
applications that Fehr and Schmidt propose with apparent success.</p>
<p>Another question concerns how the theory is applied given Fehr and
Schmidt&rsquo;s assumption that people vary in their degrees of inequity
aversion. In other words, the values of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are
heterogenous across a population. Note that predictions can only be
derived from the inequity aversion model if the values of \(\alpha\) and
\(\beta\) are known. But, every experiment or situation potentially
involves a different sample, and there is no value of \(\alpha\) and
\(\beta\) that is universally held. The most straightforward solution
would be to identify a marginal and joint distribution of \(\alpha\) and
\(\beta\), and one can assume that each experimental sample is
representative of the population distribution. Fehr and Schmidt (1999,
2003) do exactly this using experimental data from the ultimatum game,
defined in the forthcoming section. Binmore and Shaked (2010, p 92)
question whether Fehr and Schmidt keep these distributions constant when
predicting data in future experiments, a criticism that I shall return
to in Section III.</p>
<p>Finally, to apprehend the stakes of these criticisms, one should note
the popularity of the inequity aversion model. The landmark <em>QJE</em> paper
by Fehr and Schmidt (1999) has been cited 11,396 times according to
Google Scholar&mdash;a six-fold increase since 2010. Binmore and Shaked
(2010, p 90) examine the breakdown of these papers and find that few
question the empirical adequacy of inequity aversion or its appropriate
range of application. Most cite their work as an established development
in the field of behavioral economics. Some even consider the model
important enough to be worth teaching to undergraduates (Wilkinson,
2008). It must either be the case that Binmore and Shaked&rsquo;s criticisms
have been overlooked by the academic community or have been duly
assessed as unproblematic. I consider the latter case to be unlikely.</p>

</h2><p>In the forthcoming sections, I will discuss and allude to four different
types of games to which Fehr and Schmidt apply their model: the
ultimatum game, the public goods game, auction games, and bonus contract
games.</p>
<p>The ultimatum game involves two parties, anonymous to one another. The
proposer, endowed with a sum of money, proposes a certain division to a
responder, who may either accept or veto the deal. If the responder
accepts, the two players receive money as per the agreed upon division.
If the responder rejects the offer, neither player receives money.
Interestingly, a breadth of experimental data has shown that responders
in a one-shot game consistently reject low offers and prefer receiving
nothing to a disproportionately small monetary gain. Fehr and Schmidt
(1999) point to this finding as a phenomenon that the inequity aversion
model helps to explain; fairness and reciprocity appear to be salient
concerns for ultimatum game subjects. Otherwise, Fehr and Schmidt argue,
all gainful offers would be accepted.</p>
<p>In the public goods game, subjects are allotted individual budgets. From
these, subjects can secretly make donations to be put into a shared pot,
which is multiplied at each stage by a growth factor and divided evenly
between players. Subjects may retain the resources that they do not
donate. Players who opt not to donate but receive a share of the pot are
referred to as &ldquo;free riders&rdquo;. &ldquo;Cooperators&rdquo;, on the other hand,
contribute an average or above average amount to the shared pot. There
are a few design specifications that may influence experimental results.
First, subjects may be given the option to punish free riders by
eliminating their payoffs. This specification is referred to as the
public goods game with punishment. Note that in the experiments studied
by Fehr and Schmidt (1999) punishment is costly for those who punish.
Public goods games can either proceed in multiple stages or in one. When
the same subjects play the public goods game for a series of rounds,
this is referred to as an iterated public goods game or a partner
design. When subjects only interact with one another for one round, this
is referred to as a one-shot public goods game or a stranger design. The
stranger design is the standard experimental technique because the
partner design introduces the variable of shared experience, which
complicates how data is to be interpreted. As I will discuss, Fehr and
Schmidt interestingly opt to use the partner design. In any case, they
consider the public goods game to be a crucial test of the theory, as
they assert that experimental findings diverge from the predictions of
the money-maximizing model. Thus, Fehr and Schmidt argue, their theory
may better explain the data.</p>
<p>There are two varieties of auction or market games that Fehr and Schmidt
consider. The first is an auction game with proposer competition, which
proceeds as follows. Multiple proposers are each afforded a sum of
money. All proposers offer a share of their budget to a single
responder, who will accept or reject the highest offer. If a proposer&rsquo;s
offer is rejected, neither does the responder receive any money nor may
the proposer keep any of his/her initial funds. If one proposer makes
the highest bid and if the bid is accepted, the money is divided
accordingly. If multiple proposers are tied for the highest accepted
bid, one is randomly chosen to divide his/her budget with the responder.
The second kind of auction game that Fehr and Schmidt examine involves
responder competition. This scenario involves a single proposer making a
uniform offer to many responders. Among accepting responders, one is
chosen at random to divide the budget with the proposer. Fehr and
Schmidt admit that the money-maximizing model performs well with market
games. Their aim in examining it is only to show that the inequity
aversion model performs equally well.</p>
<p>In a number of papers, Fehr and Schmidt different kinds of contract
games. For the purposes of this paper, I focus on bonus contract games.
The experiments in question involve principals giving contracts to an
agent. The principal stipulates a wage, an effort level, and a bonus.
Neither the agent&rsquo;s effort nor the bonus are contractually enforceable.
At a final stage, the principal chooses whether or not to award the
bonus. Fehr and Schmidt (2005) point to the data generated from bonus
contract experiments as consistent with the aggregate predictions of the
inequity aversion model. One reason Fehr, Klein, and Schmidt (2007)
think it important to examine bonus contracts is that these contracts
contain an implicit fairness clause; if agents expend a satisfactory
amount of effort, it is fair that a bonus would be awarded. Thus,
subjects&rsquo; behavior in stipulating and awarding bonus contracts is
perhaps a crucial test of the inequity aversion model.</p>

</h2><p>The first major charge leveled against Fehr and Schmidt is that they
fail to disclose a number of tactics that portray their theory more
favorably. The problematic tactics in question are examples of what
Binmore and Shaked (2010) refer to as &ldquo;favorable selection&rdquo;. I consider
three cases. First, Fehr and Schmidt (1999) count auction games as a
predictive success when many other models can predict the same events
with equivalent success. Second, for the public goods game without
punishment, Fehr and Schmidt (1999) opt for the partner design rather
than the standard stranger design, which produces starkly different
outcomes than what the inequity aversion model would predict. In
addition, they favorably select the rival theory against which they
evaluate their own model&rsquo;s performance. Third, in analyzing bonus
contract games (Fehr and Schmidt, 2004; Fehr et al, 2005; Fehr et al,
2007), Fehr and Schmidt selectively ignore the many failed predictions
antecedent to the averages they find to be in line with their model&rsquo;s
predictions. I shall discuss each of these criticisms in turn and assess
their veracity.</p>
<p>If data from some experiment is predicted successfully by a wide range
of rival theories, the same data cannot serve as a challenging test of
the adequacy of a new theory, as the events in question are easy to
predict. But, Fehr and Schmidt (1999) seem to commit this exact folly by
using their model to predict auction games with proposer and responder
competition&mdash;games that many other models predict with apparent
success. Interestingly, under both game specifications, even when
traders are assumed to have &ldquo;zero-intelligence&rdquo;, or bid at random
subject to a budget constraint, predicted outcomes are largely in line
with empirical data (Binmore and Shaked, 2010, p 95; Gode and Sunder,
1995).</p>
<p>For the auction game with proposer competition, Fehr and Schmidt&rsquo;s model
successfully predicts that experienced proposers will offer all surplus
to responders. However, they make a mistake in experimental design by
failing to allow responders to choose an equitable offer over the
highest offer (Binmore and Shaked, 2010, p 95). Had they allowed for
this choice, their theory could have been crucially tested&mdash;confirmed
or disconfirmed. Instead, what they found tells us very little beyond
that their model can predict outcomes that are just as easily predicted
by other models. For the auction game with responder competition, the
inequity aversion model, consistent with observed data, predicts that
experienced responders will accept very low offers. Again, the
money-maximizing model generates the same prediction. For these reasons,
as Binmore and Shaked (2010) declare, this easily predictable game
offers little in the way of supporting the inequity aversion theory, and
Fehr and Schmidt&rsquo;s decision to feature it in defense of their model is
puzzling and perhaps somewhat deceptive.</p>
<p>A second example of favorable selection lies in Fehr and Schmidt&rsquo;s
(1999) decision to examine the public goods game without punishment
under the partner design specification rather than the stranger design.
Subjects tend to play more cooperatively under the partner design, a
factor that would inflate the empirical adequacy of an inequity aversion
model relative to the stranger design. Because of the dubious empirical
adequacy of backward induction, standard practice is to examine one-shot
games using the stranger design, which makes it even more peculiar that
Fehr and Schmidt would opt for the partner design. Binmore and Shaked
(2010, p 93) show that had Fehr and Schmidt examined data from different
specifications of the game, their model would have performed
substantially worse than it did. Moreover, they do not compare their
predictions with the no-punishment experimental data that appears in
Fehr and Gächter (2000) despite citing data from this paper when
examining the game <em>with</em> punishment. As Binmore and Shaked (2010, p 94)
note, had they used the numbers from Fehr and Gächter (2000), they would
have found an even larger discrepancy between the prediction and data
than they did&mdash;an indication that the model fails to predict the
behavior of nearly 49% of subjects.</p>
<p>When analyzing the public goods game with punishment, Fehr and Schmidt
also opt for the partner design. For this variation of the public goods
game, it may be argued that the inequity aversion model predicts better
than does the money-maximizing model. However, Binmore and Shaked point
out three different kinds of favorable selection that Fehr and Schmidt
employ in making this claim. First, their model&rsquo;s prediction is more
accurate under the partner design specification, wherein rates of
maximum contribution are 80%, than under the stranger design
specification, wherein only 10% contribute the maximum. Binmore and
Shaked note that it is unnecessary for Fehr and Schmidt to use the
unconventional partner design, as even the 10% maximum contribution rate
of the stranger design is sufficient to challenge the supposedly unique
money-maximizing prediction that all subjects will free ride. About this
instance of favorable selection, Fehr and Schmidt (2010) say nothing
other than to assert that the lower contribution rates of a stranger
design would not be inconsistent with their model, which allows for a
range of equilibria. However, if any level of contribution can be
defended as a prediction of the model, it makes little sense to claim
that their model meaningfully or uniquely predicts the data observed
under the partner design; their model does not predictively favor the
observed equilibrium more than it does any other equilibrium.</p>
<p>Moreover, Fehr and Schmidt favorably select the variation of the
money-maximizing model against which they compare their model&rsquo;s
performance. For example, money-maximizing models that attribute
irrational behavior to a small fraction of the population generate
different predictions than what Fehr and Schmidt (1999) regard as the
unique money-maximizing prediction (Binmore and Shaked, 2010, p 94;
Kreps et al, 1982). In fact, there are a range of Nash equilibria under
the money-maximizing model including all players contributing the
maximum. This is because even experienced players may have never learned
to evaluate subgames that have never been reached. Consider the
following example given by Binmore and Shaked (2010, p 95). Assume that
every player at the outset intends to punish others who fail to
contribute the maximum. Nobody deviates for fear of being punished, and,
for this reason, nobody learns that punishing players who will never
again be encountered is pointless. As such, all players contributing the
maximum is a Nash equilibrium, and Fehr and Schmidt are therefore wrong
to uniquely identify the money-maximizing model with the prediction that
all players will free ride. In their reply to Binmore and Shaked (2010),
Fehr and Schmidt (2010) offer no defense of this alleged instance of
favorable selection.</p>
<p>A final instance of favorable selection is evident in Fehr and Schmidt&rsquo;s
application of their model to bonus contract games. As previously
discussed, the experiments in question involves a principal offering a
contract (wage, effort level, and bonus) to an agent. The agent may
decide how much effort to exert, and the principal may decide whether or
not to award the bonus. Fehr and Schmidt claim to successfully predict
the average wage offered by principals, average bonus awarded, and
average effort level. Problematically for Fehr and Schmidt, Binmore and
Shaked (2010) identify a number of failed predictions antecedent to
these predicted averages. For instance, the 40-60 distribution that Fehr
and Schmidt assume in order to obtain these averages are clearly
inconsistent with the observed percentage of principals who exhibit
inequity averse behavior. Moreover, the inequity aversion model would
predict that the bonuses offered by inequity-averse principals would
equalize payoffs of principals and agents, but the data clearly refutes
this prediction. Fehr and Schmidt (2004) and Fehr et al (2005, 2007)
ignore these disconfirming observations and conveniently focus instead
on the averages. Unquestionably, this is an instance of favorable
selection; their model fails to predict all granular empirical findings,
of which the averages that their model predicts are derivative. When
discussing the inequity aversion model&rsquo;s predictive shortcomings, I
further consider these contract games in the next section.</p>

</h2><p>Even when overlooking Fehr and Schmidt&rsquo;s misleading communicative
tactics, it appears that the inequity aversion model predicts quite
poorly for the games Fehr and Schmidt claim as confirmation of their
theory. Binmore and Shaked (2010) substantiate this claim for three
kinds of games: public goods games without punishment (partner design),
auctioning games, and bonus contract games.</p>
<p>For public goods games without punishment, the inequity aversion model
predicts that nearly 98.48% of subjects will be free riders, but the
data yields an average of 73%&mdash;a relative difference of 35%. Glossing
over this considerable difference, Fehr and Schmidt (1999) say, &ldquo;Thus,
it seems fair to say that our model is consistent with the bulk of
individual choices in this game&rdquo; (p 845). Further, the money-maximizing
model appears to issue a nearly identical prediction of 100% free
riders. Assessing the predictive efficacy of the inequity aversion model
requires a standard of comparison: how well the model performs relative
to its alternatives. Given that the model hardly performs better with
regard to this game than does the money-maximizing model, it makes
little sense to count this data as evidence for the theory. Fehr and
Schmidt (2010) take a concessionary tone in their response; they
emphasize that they claimed only to roughly approximate the choices of
experimental subjects. Even if Fehr and Schmidt&rsquo;s defense is true,
Binmore and Shaked (2010) are correct to claim that the theory&rsquo;s
predictive shortcomings cast doubt on its adequacy for explanatory
purposes. After all, a theory cannot be said to make sense of the
data&mdash;as Fehr and Schmidt assert&mdash;if it entails outcomes that are
empirically contradicted. I return later to a discussion of the related
aims of prediction and explanation.</p>
<p>As previously discussed, the same appears to be true for the auctioning
games, as many alternative models predict the same outcomes; even if
players bid at random subject to a budget constraint, predictions are
consistent with experimental data (Gode and Sunder, 1995).
Money-maximizing models, in particular, do very well with these games.
Thus, auctioning games offer no predictive basis for preferring the
inequity aversion model, and in a footnote, Fehr and Schmidt (2010)
admit as much (p 102).</p>
<p>Finally, the inequity aversion model fails to predict bonus contract
games in a number of ways. Fehr and Schmidt assume for their predictive
purposes that 40% of individuals are inequity averse. For the sample
population in Fehr et al (2007), it seems that only 27% of principals
are inequity averse. If Fehr and Schmidt were to use a 27-73 ratio of
inequity averse individuals to money-maximizers, the theory predicts no
cooperation between principals and agents, with money-maximizing agents
choosing low effort levels and principals generally opting not to award
bonuses&mdash;a far cry from what the 40-60 distribution predicts. The same
appears to be true of the fraction of inequity-averse individuals
observed in Fehr and Schmidt (2004); 15.7% of individuals exhibit
behavior consistent with inequity aversion, and the 40-60 distribution
would contradict the non-cooperative consequent. Even if Fehr and
Schmidt successfully predict the average bonus, average initial offer,
and average effort level, they fail to predict any of the decisions and
distributions that these averages stem from&mdash;hence, the charge of
favorable selection by Binmore and Shaked (2010). What this shows is
that there must exist some rival theory that would accurately predict
granular behavior as well as aggregate tendencies, and, as such, the
data seems to disconfirm inequity aversion theory rather than supporting
it.</p>
<p>To understand the implications of these predictive deficiencies, a
couple of questions must be explored. First, to what extent is
behavioral game theory a predictive endeavor, an explanatory one, or
both? With these aims in mind, why might one prefer the inequity
aversion model to its alternatives? Finally, do the inequity aversion
model&rsquo;s predictive and explanatory features bear on its optimal domain
of application? I explore each of these questions in turn.</p>
<p>On the explanatory account of game theory, one would regard game theory
as accounting for the <em>reasoning</em> processes that motivate behavioral
outcomes. The defense offered by Fehr and Schmidt (2010) seems to echo
this claim. An explanatory conception of game theory asks <em>why</em> subjects
act in certain ways. For Fehr and Schmidt, the salient question is why
experimental data reveals that subjects sometimes act as if they are not
pure money-maximizers and perhaps exhibit other-regarding preferences
(Fehr and Schmidt, 2010, p 102-103). The inequity aversion model was put
forth in an effort to explain this finding. It assumes that subjects act
out an ingrained psychological preference for more equal outcomes. A
predictive account of game theory, on the other hand, focuses on mere
strategic <em>behavior</em>, not reasoning. <em>Why</em> subjects act as they do is
irrelevant (and often unknowable). All that is relevant is that <em>how</em>
they act is consistent with what the model predicts. Whether Fehr and
Schmidt&rsquo;s work can be defended depends largely on how one understands
the game theoretic task <em>qua</em> prediction or explanation. I examine how
the inequity aversion model is assessed and applied in order to
determine whether prediction or explanation is more fundamental. The
inequity aversion model is useful for explanatory purposes if
experimental data reveals subjects behaving <em>as if</em> they are averse to
inequities. Whether or not inequities factor into a subject&rsquo;s
motivations is not observable from behavior alone. Thus, to the extent
that behavior deviates from the model&rsquo;s predictions, the motivations
that the model attributes to subjects cannot suffice for explanatory
purposes. Predictive deficiencies, therefore, weigh heavily against the
explanatory virtues that Fehr and Schmidt claim in support of their
theory. Second, one could question whether game theoretic modeling
serves an explanatory purpose at all. Game theory seeks to model social
behavior, not motivations. Hypotheses about motivations, however, may
emerge as a byproduct of predictive successes and failures, and
psychological studies may follow. Whether game theory plays an
explanatory role is beyond the scope of this paper, but suffice it to
say that the predictive shortcomings of the inequity aversion model
certainly cast doubt on its explanatory value.</p>
<p>There are multiple reasons why one model might be preferable to another.
A few include range of application or universality, ability to account
for anomalous data, simplicity or elegance, and consistency with wider
bodies of knowledge (psychological theory, for instance).</p>
<p>A more universal theory can be applied to a wider range of situations
than can a more provincial one. Accordingly, Fehr and Schmid (1999)
claim that their theory &ldquo;can be applied to any game&rdquo; (p 856). However,
as Binmore and Shaked (2010) point out, what subjects perceive as fair
and the extent to which they value fairness depends on a number of
contextual situations; people do not expect others to evenly split the
contents of their wallets with strangers they pass on the street even if
they may prefer to do so in an ultimatum game setup. On the other hand,
the social norms approach appears to be more universally applicable
relative to the inequity aversion model. Social norms are possibly
present in all social contexts, and, once identified, subjects'
sensitivity to the norm can be measured empirically. A relevant
consideration in assessing a theory&rsquo;s proper domain of application is in
which contexts it predicts better than rival theories. For the inequity
aversion model to have substantial appeal, there must be a reasonable
number of contexts in which it performs better than its alternatives. It
seems, as per the predictive deficiencies highlighted by Binmore and
Shaked (2010), that the model does not do so.</p>
<p>Fehr and Schmidt claim as an advantage of their theory that it predicts
experimental findings that money-maximizing models cannot account
for&mdash;what one might call anomalous data, unassimilable by the dominant
paradigm. The puzzle in question that Fehr and Schmidt claim to solve is
why other-regarding preferences appear to be operative in some subjects
and contexts but not in others. The favorable selection problem I
discuss earlier impugns this claim, as much of the data that they claim
as anomalous would in fact be accommodated by reasonable variations of
the money-maximizing model. Moreover, the predictions that do appear
more accurate are not unique predictions of the inequity aversion model;
a number of less accurate predictions could be claimed as equilibria.
Finally, as this section recounts, the model fails to predict several
games that Fehr and Schmidt consider to be crucial tests of their
theory. For these reasons, I conclude that the inequity aversion model
does not deal with anomalous findings significantly better than do other
models.</p>
<p>Another purported virtue of the inequity aversion model is that it is
simple and tractable. In other words, it assumes relatively little and
can be applied to a variety of situations with few formal adjustments.
Tractability is hardly an advantage of this theory over its major
rivals&mdash;the social norms and money-maximizing paradigms. Each of these
alternatives can be just as easily applied to different situations, and
the social norms approach, in particular, offers the ability to directly
measure the importance of a norm rather than calibrating a parameter
using a different experimental situation, as in the case of the inequity
aversion model. It is true that the inequity aversion model is simple,
however, but, again, no simpler than its rivals. Both the social norms
and money-maximizing approaches posit very little about subjects'
motivations. In fact, one could argue that the inequity aversion model
assumes more by assuming from the outset that fairness considerations
are present. The social norms approach, on the other hand, measures the
importance of a norm rather than assuming it. Neither simplicity not
tractability, it seems, are relative strengths of Fehr and Schmidt&rsquo;s
model.</p>
<p>A model&rsquo;s consistency with theory in other domains may also be claimed
as an advantage over its rivals. If an empirically adequate model
expresses certain synergies with successful theories in psychology, for
instance, it may be preferable to models whose assumptions contradict
those same theories. For instance, money-maximizing models fail to
account for psychological motives that often yield non-money-maximizing
outcomes. This theoretical virtue to some extent reflects the
explanatory aims of theory, though the explanatory relevance of game
theoretic models comes not from the model alone but from its ability to
successfully predict using realistic assumptions. On this view, one must
also hold that realism is a crucial feature of behavioral models. Fehr
and Schmidt (1999) claim this advantage for their theory and say
explicitly, &ldquo;Our theory is motivated by the psychological evidence on
social comparison and loss aversion&rdquo; (p 856). Insofar as the psychology
they appeal to seems conclusive, this is a virtue of the inequity
aversion model. However, Binmore and Shaked (2010) prefer the social
norms approach on the grounds that subjects&rsquo; other-regarding preferences
are context-dependent. Thus, the psychological theories that Fehr and
Schmidt apply are only conditionally applicable, and, in behavioral
experiments, one can never know <em>a priori</em> which conscious or
subconscious motives are operative. A social norms approach perhaps
better account for these contextual considerations that are only
measurable empirically, <em>a posteriori</em>. The inequity aversion model,
therefore, while formalizing established psychological motives, does not
do so in a manner that is comprehensive and is not justified in its
generalizing assumption.</p>

</h2><p>Fehr and Schmidt&rsquo;s use of parameters poses an additional methodological
concern. In assessing a theory, it is necessary to compare forecasts to
data, and the inequity aversion model is formalized such that parameters
must be set before forecasts can be produced. Much of the forecasting
successes that Fehr and Schmidt tout in defense their theory rely on a
parametric distribution abstracted from ultimatum game experimental
data. Binmore and Shaked (2010) allege that Fehr and Schmidt use
floating parameters; they revise the distributions they use according to
the data that they wish to predict.</p>
<p>Binmore and Shaked focus on a few specific cases of Fehr and Schmidt
deviating from their &ldquo;calibrated&rdquo; distributions. The calibration they
settle upon in their <em>Quarterly Journal of Economics</em> paper (1999) is as
follows:</p>

<p>joint distribution</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The four types of individuals are shown in the rightmost table. Each
joint distribution corresponds to a different degree of inequity
aversion. While Fehr and Schmidt (1999) make clear that these
distributions reflect their ultimatum game data, it is less clear
exactly how they do so. For instance, as Binmore and Shaked (2010, p 92)
note, no data is given pertaining to the joint distribution of \(\alpha\)
and \(\beta\). This observation suggests that the parameters are
under-identified and may float to a considerable degree. The fact that
these parameters can float is evidenced in Fehr and Schmidt&rsquo;s analysis
of three contract games (Binmore and Shaked, 2010, pp 96-98). Three
papers exhibit an altered distribution from the one declared in the
<em>QJE</em> paper (1999): one on bonus, trust and incentive contracts (Fehr at
al, 2007); another on joint ownership contracts (Fehr et al, 2005); and
a final one on piecewise and bonus contracts (Fehr and Schmidt, 2004).
In each, Fehr and Schmidt use a 40-60 distribution, wherein 40% of
subjects are inequity averse (\(\alpha = 2\) and \(\beta = 0.6\)) and 60% of
subjects are money-maximizers, with α and β values of zero. This
distribution treats as money-maximizers the 30% of subjects in the QJE
joint distribution for whom \(\alpha = 0.5\) and \(\beta = 0.25\). Binmore
and Shaked (2010, p 97) correctly note that this distributional
difference is meaningful; subjects with mild inequity aversion are not
behaviorally identical to pure money-maximizers. Thus, it seems that the
choice to deviate from the <em>QJE</em> distribution must be justified.</p>
<p>Fehr and Schmidt (2010, p 105) defend this decision by arguing that the
40-60 distribution is a simplification of the distribution used in Fehr
and Schmidt (1999), as it would be too tedious and inelegant to consider
four types of individuals in their analyses of contract games. As
previously noted, calling the difference a mere simplification does not
suffice; reclassifying mildly inequity averse subjects as
money-maximizers changes what predictions follow. Fehr and Schmidt must
independently justify the 40-60 distribution as one that yields valid
predictions.</p>
<p>Second, Fehr and Schmidt (2010, pp 103-104) argue that adherence to the
original distribution is not necessary, as their three papers on
contract games are not intended as tests of inequity aversion but as
rough interpretative exercises&mdash;mere illustrations of how fairness
models can make sense of contract game behavior. To apply the model as
an interpretative exercise takes for granted the very thing that is in
question: whether the model deserves explanatory consideration given its
severe predictive shortcomings. A few questions follow. Would it not be
more appropriate if their papers were intended as tests of the model?
After all, the data being roughly interpreted should be predictable if
inequity aversion were empirically successful&mdash;as Fehr and Schmidt must
surely hope to demonstrate. Moreover, if their theory and its proper
parametric distributions are too inelegant to be useful for this
predictive task, should that not count against the usefulness of the
theory? The four-type distribution should not be so tedious that the
theory&rsquo;s chief advocates and originators cannot use it for prediction.</p>
<p>Third, Fehr and Schmidt (2010) note that their <em>QJE</em> distribution is not
a unique one, so they do not disregard their ultimatum game findings in
changing their distribution. Rather, the distribution they originally
declare is merely <em>suggested</em> as one among many that are potentially
consistent with the ultimatum game data. They acknowledge that &ldquo;there
are many degrees of freedom in choosing a distribution consistent with
the ultimatum game&rdquo; (p 104). This statement serves as explicit
confirmation of Binmore and Shaked&rsquo;s (2010) suggestion that their
parameters are under-identified. Perhaps the 40-60 distribution is
compatible with Fehr and Schmidt&rsquo;s empirical findings, but there are
serious problems with the flexibility they exploit in applying their
model. In order to confirm or disconfirm a theory, one must be able to
derive testable predictions from it, but if the parameters can vary
considerably, so too can the consequent predictions. The model is
therefore harder to falsify and easier to confirm, as it is consistent
with a wide range of observations. Until the theory&rsquo;s proponents are
able to pin down parameters, perhaps using additional auxiliary
assumptions, the model should not be treated as a viable (or testable)
predictive tool, let alone an explanatory one. Even if some are
motivated by sheer faith that their work on the model will be
vindicated, scholars should adopt a critical lens when assessing Fehr
and Schmidt&rsquo;s work. Because Fehr and Schmidt enjoy substantial freedom
in choosing parametric distributions, it is plausible that the
distributions they have chosen yield more favorable predictions than do
alternative distributions that are consistent with the ultimatum game.
Fehr and Schmidt (1999) offer few reasons for preferring their
distribution other than that it is consistent with the ultimatum game
data&mdash;like many other distributions seem to be. Since Fehr and Schmidt
insufficiently support the distributions they choose, there is no reason
to think that the predictions issued from these distributions constitute
effective tests of the model&rsquo;s credibility.</p>
<p>A question then arises: what is a more appropriate method of calibrating
a model? The inequity aversion model makes a particular assumption about
what motivates people. However, these motivations are apt to vary in
different contexts. As such, it is methodologically suspect that Fehr
and Schmidt derive parametric distributions that fit ultimatum game data
and use the same distribution in many other games. Moreover, the extent
to which ultimatum game behavior is motivated by inequity aversion is a
<em>psychological</em> consideration, unknowable through the lens of behavior
without surveying social expectations and attitudes. As such, if the
explanatory or predictive power of the fairness assumption is to be
tested, Fehr and Schmidt ought to find a way to measure degrees of
inequity aversion in each experimental context. Contrast this approach
with that of social norms theory. Adherents to this paradigm survey
experimental subjects to assess empirical expectations, normative
expectations, and social expectations, which allow identification of the
relevant norms (Bicchieri, 2006). Context- and subject-specific
attitudes must be measured for a parametric distribution to be properly
set and for the model&rsquo;s assumptions to be crucially tested.</p>
<p>Setting parameters in good faith requires consistency and transparency.
Parametric distributions should be set using data and data alone&mdash;not
set according to the subjective preferences of the authors. Fehr and
Schmidt&rsquo;s convenient use of a more elegant or simple distribution trades
off with methodological integrity. To the extent that data alone does
not dictate the distribution in the same way each time, the model&rsquo;s
predictions are <em>indefinite</em>. One way that Fehr and Schmidt may
crucially test their theory is by sticking to (and defending) their
assumption that ultimatum game data reflects a global population
distribution of inequity averse attitudes. If predictions then fail,
then either this assumption from which parameters are derived must be
revised or the utility function itself must be. Alternatively, a
different calibration method may be adopted like the one used by the
social norms model: attitudinal surveys. Moreover, Fehr and Schmidt are
not transparent about how and when they vary their distributions. As
noted earlier, they do not show how their joint distribution is derived,
nor do they fully explain their reasons for deviating from the ultimatum
game distribution until their 2010 response to Binmore and Shaked. For
these reasons, I find that Fehr and Schmidt&rsquo;s approach to
parameter-setting is scientifically substandard.</p>

</h2><p>I have discussed three kinds of criticisms that Binmore and Shaked
(2010) have leveled against Fehr and Schmidt: favorable selection,
predictive inadequacy, and use of floating parameters. Each has weighty
implications on how the inequity aversion model should be evaluated.
Fehr and Schmidt favorably select events to predict, what to treat as
the model&rsquo;s prediction, and what rival theories to compare the model&rsquo;s
performance to. Insofar as they do so, the empirical adequacy of the
model should remain in doubt, as the model&rsquo;s handle on events that are
even remotely challenging to predict has not been proven. Even for the
mild predictive challenges that Fehr and Schmidt <em>do</em> undertake, their
model performs unimpressively. In some cases, its predictions are quite
inaccurate. In others, the model performs no better than its
alternatives&mdash;namely, variants of the money-maximizing model. Finally,
Fehr and Schmidt&rsquo;s use of floating parameters raises doubts about the
definiteness of their model&rsquo;s forecasts. It is difficult to falsify a
model whose predictions are a moving target. Moreover, because Fehr and
Schmidt are those who set their parameters&rsquo; distributions, it is
possible that they adjust their distributions in order to generate more
favorable predictions. As Binmore and Shaked (2010) note, such a process
would entail that Fehr and Schmidt are engaged in a <em>fitting</em> exercise
as opposed to a <em>predicting</em> exercise (p 92). Before they can
meaningfully test their theory, Fehr and Schmidt must offer fixed and
detailed assumptions from which their parameters&rsquo; distributions can be
precisely determined. In reviewing the responses given by Fehr and
Schmidt, I find no satisfactory justifications for these serious
methodological and empirical flaws, and, unless these issues have been
remedied in their subsequent work, there seems little reason to assign
credibility to their model.</p>
